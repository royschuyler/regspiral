Imagine an x,y plane with center (0,0). From center, there var n amount are straight lines skewing out divided by equal degrees and go a full 360 degrees. From center there are also m amount of circles of different sizes spaced equally. We are going to create spirals by connecting the intersection points of {straight line 1} and {circle point a}, then {straight line 2} and {circle point b}. I want an index.html file that has slider bars that control the var n amount of lines, m abount of circles and t for total number of degrees the spiral wil travel. I don't want the circle/line graph to show, only the spiral it creates as a thin (0.5) black line. I want a downloadable button.

n. min: 10, max: 1,000, default: 100
m. min: 10, max: 1,000, default: 100
t. min: 10, max: 2,000, default: 360



Now imagine a a circle drawn where the spiral starts with it's center at the start of the spiral and it's size (var s, slider variable). Then imagine the "next circle" is drawn with it's center on the spiral and it's size (s*r s id for size and r is for rate eg. rate of size change), and the "next circle" with center on the spiral intersects with the circle before it at it's center.

      <input type="range" id="sizeSlider" min="1" max="8" step="1" value="4">
      <span id="sizeValue">20</span>

    <div class="control">
      <label for="rateSlider">Growth Rate (r):</label>
      <input type="range" id="rateSlider" min="1" max="1.4" step="0.02" value="1.2">
      <span id="rateValue">1.5</span>
