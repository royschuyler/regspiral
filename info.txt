Imagine an x,y plane with center (0,0). From center, there var n amount are straight lines skewing out divided by equal degrees and go a full 360 degrees. From center there are also m amount of circles of different sizes spaced equally. We are going to create spirals by connecting the intersection points of {straight line 1} and {circle point a}, then {straight line 2} and {circle point b}. I want an index.html file that has slider bars that control the var n amount of lines, m abount of circles and t for total number of degrees the spiral wil travel. I don't want the circle/line graph to show, only the spiral it creates as a thin (0.5) black line. I want a downloadable button.

n. min: 10, max: 1,000, default: 100
m. min: 10, max: 1,000, default: 100
t. min: 10, max: 2,000, default: 360
