Imagine an x,y plane with center (0,0). From center, there var n amount are straight lines skewing out divided by equal degrees and go a full 360 degrees. From center there are also n circles of different sizes spaced by {algorythm TBD}. We are going to create spirals by connecting the intersection points of {straight line 1} and {circle point a}, then {straight line 2} and {circle point b}. I want an index.html file that has slider bars that control the var n amount of lines/circles.  

Here is how I want the circles sized. This is comming from a spreasheet.
A2=100 {This will be n}
A8=radians(90)
A10=A8/A2
G10=0
G11=1
G12=2
{G continues this pattern all the way to G110 or 10 plus whatever A2 is}
H10=$A$10*G10
H11=$A$10*G11
H12=$A$10*G12
{H cotineus this pattern to H110 or 10 plus whatever A2 is}

C2 is a variable in a slider. -2 to 3. default 1

J10=1-=(SIN(H10))^$C$2
J11=1-=(SIN(H11))^$C$2
J12=1-=(SIN(H12))^$C$2
{J cotineus this pattern to J110 or 10 plus whatever A2 is}

I want them spaced by the J value, get it? They are closer together at the center.

I want a slider bar to dictate the total degrees the spiral travels default 360. min: 45, max 3000.

So, to racap:
var n for number of straight lines. 100 - 5,000. default 2,000
C2, lets call it var f in a slider. -2 to 3. default 1

And I want a downloadable button


I want a spiral program that forms from the intersection of a straight line from center (0,0) and a circle with center also at (0,0). I want n number of straight lines and also n number of circles. The spacing of the straight lines are of equal degrees from center. SO, if n = 100 then each line would be (360/100) + i. The spacing of the circles should be derived from the J column pattern such that circles congrigate more at the center and gradually get larger to the end. Please put allin an index.html file with var n and f as sliders. Also a slider for how many total degrees the spiral turns{min 90, max 1440, default 360}. And a downloadable button

J10=1-(COS(H10))^$C$2
J11=1-(COS(H11))^$C$2
J12=1-(COS(H12))^$C$2
{continues}

H10=$A$10*G10
H11=$A$10*G11
H12=$A$10*G12
{continues}

G10=0
G11=1
G12=2
{contines to Gn eg. if n = 100 then G110=100}

A10=RADIANS(90)/n

C2 let's call var f = {slider variable. min: 1, max 10, default: 1}
