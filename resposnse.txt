ABout AI - Coming from a software engineering background, this stuff hits me on a personal level. I worked really hard to learn these skills, and they significantly elevated my career. Suddenly, I had the ability to live comfortably, take vacations, go out to dinner, even handle emergencies like car repairs or replacing an HVAC system without stress. So naturally, when I think about becoming potentially obsolete because of AI, it's genuinely frightening. There's a fear of losing the pride that comes with earning a good paycheck, losing the identity attached to the job. But at the same time, I've always managed to get by, and I don't think that will change

Shifting to the creative side, the artist in me—the part people usually stereotype as being separate from my engineering self—that journey has been incredibly rewarding, filled with trial and error, growth, and learning through experiences. And now suddenly, anyone can tap into that process instantly, thanks to AI. In a way, it feels unfair, right? Something that took me years, someone else can now accomplish in seconds, with just a prompt and imagination. But reflecting on it, life really is about the journey, not the destination. I say that having lived it, with the luxury of hindsight. But who am I to determine what's valuable for the next generation?

Consider a future where every morning there's a new Mozart piece, as profound as the original. Or waking up daily to a new Dalí painting, just as surreal and inspiring. Imagine a new Joni Mitchell album tailored perfectly to your mood—every single day. It's staggering, but exciting. Who am I to judge the quality or value of a life born into this kind of abundance?

We've had the internet as a powerful tool for decades, and someone born within the last 70 years might say that's the perfect balance of struggle and reward. But is it really? That's just our perspective because it's what we've lived through. AI isn't going away—it's only getting more advanced. In some ways, it's just nature happening at a remarkable speed. People have always been part of this evolutionary arms race; technology is just the newest extension of it. We don't reverse progress. We can't put this back in the box, even if we wanted to.

Maybe it's selfish of me to feel threatened or soul-sucked because others can now achieve without struggle what took me years. I was never particularly good at drawing or painting, though I wished I could paint like Picasso. Recently, I experimented with an AI image generator, asking it to create abstract cubist pieces on the human condition. Within seconds, there were these beautiful images, something beyond my imagination. If I wanted, I could print them, sketch them, and through trial and error mix paints and colors and eventually claim them as mine. But is that cheating? Probably not for future generations.

Yet I wonder—is that a life worth living? Typing prompts and filling in the outlines provided by AI? There's little struggle, endless inspiration, and endless content. It’s going to redefine creativity completely. It's unsettling, but exciting. Imagine a future with digital 'assistants' or even digital 'slaves,' if you will. Our discomfort with this is probably unique to us, a transitional generation grappling with the loss of how things used to be.

Ultimately, I think the quicker we can set aside our ego—the idea that others should go through what we went through because we think it’s somehow 'right'—the better. Or maybe none of it truly matters, because life, technology, and creativity will inevitably keep moving forward. So there's not really even any argument or anything to dicuss because it's already over and our way is out and the new way is in. Stumming a guitar, humming a tune and crafting a finished song, in hopes to make a living, is over. Sad for us, the next generation won't care. Harsh. It stings, but it's true.
